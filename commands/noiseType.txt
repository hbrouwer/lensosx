  This command sets the type of noise function and range of the distribution
  used by all of the input, output, or link derivative noise procedures in
  the groups. A group can only have a single noise function and range, as it
  is assumed that no more than one of these forms of noise will be used at
  any one time. The actual noise procedures are activated by including one of
  the following group types: DERIV_NOISE, IN_NOISE, IN_DERIV_NOISE,
  OUT_NOISE, OUT_DERIV_NOISE.

  The default range is 0.1 and the default noise procedure is additive and
  gaussian. In this case the range is the standard deviation and the
  distribution is centered on 0.0. -multiply will make the noise procedure
  multiplicative, scaling the values based on a distribution centered around
  1.0. -flat will make the distribution uniform, rather than gaussian, where
  the range is half the distribution width.

  Using * in place of the group name will affect all groups.

  To use additive noise selected uniformly from the range [-0.01, +0.01) on
  the "hidden" group:

        lens> noise hidden -flat -r 0.01

  To use multiplicative noise sampled from a gaussian distribution with
  standard deviation 0.1 centered around 1.0:

        lens> noise hidden -r 0.1 -m

  To eliminate the effect of noise in the network:

        lens> noise * -r 0
