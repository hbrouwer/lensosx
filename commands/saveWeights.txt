  This writes the weights for every link in the network into a special file.
  The file can be later reloaded into a network of the same architecture. If
  the file name has the extension .gz, .bz, .bz2, or .Z it will automatically
  be compressed. It is customary to give weight files the extension .wt.

  When training networks with momentum, deltaBarDelta, or other
  "sophisticated" algorithms, it is usually important to save more
  information for each link than just its weight. If num-values is 2, both
  the weights and the deltas (used by momentum) will be saved. A value of 3
  will save the weights, deltas, and "last values", which are used by
  deltaBarDelta in alens.

  If a num-values of 3 is specified in standard lens, only the weights and
  deltas will be written (as there are no lastValue fields). Therefore, you
  can use 3 to store all of the link values in either version of Lens.

  The default is to write a binary weight file. If the -text flag is given,
  values will be written in text format.

  Ordinarily, all links in the network will be saved. If -noFrozen is
  specified, frozen links will not be saved. If -onlyFrozen is specified,
  thawed links will not be saved. These are useful if you only wish to save
  part of the network.

  When using networks with randomized structures, it is important to record
  the random _s_e_e_d used when building the network so the same architecture can
  be reconstructed later. Otherwise, weight files saved with this command may
  be useless later.

  To save the weights in the compressed binary file greatNet.wt.gz:

        lens> saveWeights greatNet.wt.gz
  To save all of the link values of non-frozen weights in text format:

        lens> saveWeights foo.wt.gz -v 3 -n -t
