  The sswwiittcchh command matches its string argument against each of the pattern
  arguments in order. As soon as it finds a pattern that matches string it
  evaluates the following body argument by passing it recursively to the Tcl
  interpreter and returns the result of that evaluation. If the last pattern
  argument is ddeeffaauulltt then it matches anything. If no pattern argument
  matches string and no default is given, then the sswwiittcchh command returns an
  empty string.

  If the initial arguments to sswwiittcchh start with -- then they are treated as
  options. The following options are currently supported:



    --eexxaacctt
        Use exact matching when comparing string to a pattern. This is the
        default.

    --gglloobb
        When matching string to the patterns, use glob-style matching (i.e.
        the same as implemented by the _ss_tt_rr_ii_nn_gg_ _mm_aa_tt_cc_hh command).

    --rreeggeexxpp
        When matching string to the patterns, use regular expression matching
        (as described in the _rr_ee____ss_yy_nn_tt_aa_xx reference page).

    -- --
        Marks the end of options. The argument following this one will be
        treated as string even if it starts with a --.


  Two syntaxes are provided for the pattern and body arguments. The first
  uses a separate argument for each of the patterns and commands; this form
  is convenient if substitutions are desired on some of the patterns or
  commands. The second form places all of the patterns and commands together
  into a single argument; the argument must have proper list structure, with
  the elements of the list being the patterns and commands. The second form
  makes it easy to construct multi-line switch commands, since the braces
  around the whole list make it unnecessary to include a backslash at the end
  of each line. Since the pattern arguments are in braces in the second form,
  no command or variable substitutions are performed on them; this makes the
  behavior of the second form different than the first form in some cases.

  If a body is specified as ``--'' it means that the body for the next pattern
  should also be used as the body for this pattern (if the next pattern also
  has a body of ``--'' then the body after that is used, and so on). This
  feature makes it possible to share a single body among several patterns.

  Beware of how you place comments in sswwiittcchh commands. Comments should only
  be placed iinnssiiddee the execution body of one of the patterns, and not
  intermingled with the patterns.

  Below are some examples of sswwiittcchh commands:

    sswwiittcchh aabbcc aa -- bb {{ffoorrmmaatt 11}} aabbcc {{ffoorrmmaatt 22}} ddeeffaauulltt {{ffoorrmmaatt 33}}
  will return 22,

    sswwiittcchh --rreeggeexxpp aaaaaabb {{
    		^^aa..**bb$$ --
    		bb {{ffoorrmmaatt 11}}
    		aa** {{ffoorrmmaatt 22}}
    		ddeeffaauulltt {{ffoorrmmaatt 33}}
    }}
  will return 11, and

    sswwiittcchh xxyyzz {{

  will return 33.
