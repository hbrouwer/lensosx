  Creates a link between each unit in the first list and each unit in the
  second list. If a third unit list is specified, then all units in the
  second list will be connected to all units in the third list, and so on.

  This can be used to create a special pattern of connectivity using a
  script, rather than by altering the source code. By default the new
  connection will have a type with the same name as the sending unit's group,
  but this can be overridden.

  If mean and/or range are given, they will determine the values used for
  randomizing the link's weight. If left unspecified, the network defaults
  will be used for these links.

  If the receiving unit already has an input with the same type from a
  neighbor of the sending unit, the links will become part of the same link
  block. In that case, the mean and range specified here will override the
  previous values for the block.

  The bidirectional flag causes links to created in both directions between
  each pair of units.

  To connect the first two units of group "input" to the third unit of group
  "hidden" with a connection of type "my type" and default randomization
  values:

        lens> connectUnits "input:0 input:1" hidden:2 -type "my type"
