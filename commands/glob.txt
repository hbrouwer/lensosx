  glob - Return names of files that match patterns

  SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS

  gglloobb?switches? pattern?pattern ...?

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

  This command performs file name ``globbing'' in a fashion similar to the
  csh shell. It returns a list of the files whose names match any of the
  pattern arguments.

  If the initial arguments to gglloobb start with -- then they are treated as
  switches. The following switches are currently supported:



    --ddiirreeccttoorryy directory
        Search for files which match the given patterns starting in the given
        directory. This allows searching of directories whose name contains
        glob-sensitive characters without the need to quote such characters
        explicitly. This option may not be used in conjunction with --ppaatthh.

    --jjooiinn
        The remaining pattern arguments are treated as a single pattern
        obtained by joining the arguments with directory separators.

    --nnooccoommppllaaiinn
        Allows an empty list to be returned without error; without this
        switch an error is returned if the result list would be empty.

    --ppaatthh pathPrefix
        Search for files with the given pathPrefix where the rest of the name
        matches the given patterns. This allows searching for files with
        names similar to a given file even when the names contain glob-
        sensitive characters. This option may not be used in conjunction with
        --ddiirreeccttoorryy.

    --ttyyppeess typeList
        Only list files or directories which match typeList, where the items
        in the list have two forms. The first form is like the -type option
        of the Unix find command: b (block special file), c (character
        special file), d (directory), f (plain file), l (symbolic link), p
        (named pipe), or s (socket), where multiple types may be specified in
        the list. GGlloobb will return all files which match at least one of the
        types given.

        The second form specifies types where all the types given must match.
        These are r, w, x as file permissions, and readonly, hidden as
        special permission cases. On the Macintosh, MacOS types and creators
        are also supported, where any item which is four characters long is
        assumed to be a MacOS type (e.g. _TT_EE_XX_TT). Items which are of the form
        {macintosh type XXXX} or {macintosh creator XXXX} will match types or
        creators respectively. Unrecognised types, or specifications of
        multiple MacOS types/creators will signal an error.

        The two forms may be mixed, so --ttyyppeess {{dd ff rr ww}} will find all regular
        files OR directories that have both read AND write permissions. The
        following are equivalent:

          gglloobb --ttyyppee dd **
          gglloobb **//
        except that the first case doesn't return the trailing ``/'' and is
        more platform independent.

    -- --
        Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be
        treated as a pattern even if it starts with a --.


  The pattern arguments may contain any of the following special characters:



    ??
        Matches any single character.

    **
        Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

    [[chars]]
        Matches any single character in chars. If chars contains a sequence
        of the form a--b then any character between a and b (inclusive) will
        match.

    \\x
        Matches the character x.

    {{a,,b,,...}
        Matches any of the strings a, b, etc.


  As with csh, a ``.'' at the beginning of a file's name or just after a ``/
  '' must be matched explicitly or with a {} construct. In addition, all ``/
  '' characters must be matched explicitly.

  If the first character in a pattern is ``~'' then it refers to the home
  directory for the user whose name follows the ``~''. If the ``~'' is
  followed immediately by ``/'' then the value of the HOME environment
  variable is used.

  The gglloobb command differs from csh globbing in two ways. First, it does not
  sort its result list (use the _ll_ss_oo_rr_tt command if you want the list sorted).
  Second, gglloobb only returns the names of files that actually exist; in csh no
  check for existence is made unless a pattern contains a ?, *, or []
  construct.

  PPOORRTTAABBIILLIITTYY IISSSSUUEESS

  Unlike other Tcl commands that will accept both network and native style
  names (see the _ff_ii_ll_ee_nn_aa_mm_ee manual entry for details on how native and network
  names are specified), the gglloobb command only accepts native names.



    WWiinnddoowwss
        For Windows UNC names, the servername and sharename components of the
        path may not contain ?, *, or [] constructs. On Windows NT, if
        pattern is of the form ``~~username@@domain'' it refers to the home
        directory of the user whose account information resides on the
        specified NT domain server. Otherwise, user account information is
        obtained from the local computer. On Windows 95 and 98, gglloobb accepts
        patterns like ``.../'' and ``..../'' for successively higher up
        parent directories.

    MMaacciinnttoosshh
        When using the options, --ddiirr, --jjooiinn or --ppaatthh, glob assumes the
        directory separator for the entire pattern is the standard ``:''.
        When not using these options, glob examines each pattern argument and
        uses ``/'' unless the pattern contains a ``:''.
