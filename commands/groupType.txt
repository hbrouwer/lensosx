        groupType [(<group> | <group-list> ([+|-]<group-type>)*)]

  With no arguments, this lists the valid group types. Given the name of a
  group, it lists the types of the group. Given a group-list and a list of
  types, it sets the type of all groups in the list and then lists the
  groups' new types.

  When setting the group types with this command, you are starting from
  scratch, just as you would be when creating the group with _a_d_d_G_r_o_u_p and you
  must specify all of the types (other than defaults you don't wish to
  override). If you just want to change some types, use _c_h_a_n_g_e_G_r_o_u_p_T_y_p_e.

  Type names are normally listed with no - or + preceding them. Using a +
  before the name is essentially equivalent to using nothing. Using a -, on
  the other hand, causes the type to be removed if it would otherwise have
  been created by default. For example, to create a HIDDEN group with no
  incoming bias links, use the -BIASED type. You should think of the - as a
  minus, not as a dash.

  To list all the group types:

        lens> groupType
        Base Types
          BIAS
          ELMAN
          INPUT
          OUTPUT
        Input Types
          DISTANCE
          DOT_PRODUCT
        ...

  To see the type of a group:

        lens> groupType output
        Base Type
          OUTPUT
        Input Type
          DOT_PRODUCT
          IN_NOISE
        Output Type
          EXPONENTIAL
          OUT_INTEGR
        Cost Type
          SUM_SQUARED
        Group Criterion Type
          STANDARD_CRIT
        Other Types
          BIASED
          RESET_ON_EXAMPLE
  To change the type of the hidden and hidden2 groups:

        lens> groupType {hidden hidden2} DISTANCE LINEAR -BIASED
        Input Type
          DISTANCE
        Output Type
          LINEAR
