  This sets the order of the groups in the network's group array and thus the
  order in which the groups are updated. This is crucial for standard
  networks, but less important for continuous networks since continuous
  networks are updated synchronously.

  Any groups not listed in the order will follow those listed, but the
  previous order of such groups will not be retained. Groups will originally
  be in the order in which they were created so this command is unnecessary
  if groups were created in the desired updating order.

  For simple recurrent networks, it is important that context groups come
  before their source group.
