  Closes the channel given by channelId. ChannelId must be a channel
  identifier such as the return value from a previous _oo_pp_ee_nn or _ss_oo_cc_kk_ee_tt command.
  All buffered output is flushed to the channel's output device, any buffered
  input is discarded, the underlying file or device is closed, and channelId
  becomes unavailable for use.

  If the channel is blocking, the command does not return until all output is
  flushed. If the channel is nonblocking and there is unflushed output, the
  channel remains open and the command returns immediately; output will be
  flushed in the background and the channel will be closed when all the
  flushing is complete.

  If channelId is a blocking channel for a command pipeline then cclloossee waits
  for the child processes to complete.

  If the channel is shared between interpreters, then cclloossee makes channelId
  unavailable in the invoking interpreter but has no other effect until all
  of the sharing interpreters have closed the channel. When the last
  interpreter in which the channel is registered invokes cclloossee, the cleanup
  actions described above occur. See the _ii_nn_tt_ee_rr_pp command for a description of
  channel sharing.

  Channels are automatically closed when an interpreter is destroyed and when
  the process exits. Channels are switched to blocking mode, to ensure that
  all output is correctly flushed before the process exits.

  The command returns an empty string, and may generate an error if an error
  occurs while flushing output.
