  This immediately terminates the simulator process, returning the return-
  code as its exit status. The default code is 0, which means everything is
  OK.

  Although exits caused by using the GUI buttons or by an interrupt signal
  while the simulator is idle will ask the user for verification, invoking
  this command does not give the user a second chance.
