  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

  The hhiissttoorryy command performs one of several operations related to recently-
  executed commands recorded in a history list. Each of these recorded
  commands is referred to as an ``_e_v_e_n_t''. When specifying an event to the
  hhiissttoorryy command, the following forms may be used:



    [1]
        A number: if positive, it refers to the event with that number (all
        events are numbered starting at 1). If the number is negative, it
        selects an event relative to the current event (--11 refers to the
        previous event, --22 to the one before that, and so on). Event 00 refers
        to the current event.

    [2]
        A string: selects the most recent event that matches the string. An
        event is considered to match the string either if the string is the
        same as the first characters of the event, or if the string matches
        the event in the sense of the _ss_tt_rr_ii_nn_gg_ _mm_aa_tt_cc_hh command.


  The hhiissttoorryy command can take any of the following forms:



    hhiissttoorryy
        Same as hhiissttoorryy iinnffoo, described below.

    hhiissttoorryy aaddddcommand?eexxeecc?
        Adds the command argument to the history list as a new event. If eexxeecc
        is specified (or abbreviated) then the command is also executed and
        its result is returned. If eexxeecc isn't specified then an empty string
        is returned as result.

    hhiissttoorryy cchhaannggeenewValue ?event?
        Replaces the value recorded for an event with newValue. Event
        specifies the event to replace, and defaults to the current event
        (not event --11). This command is intended for use in commands that
        implement new forms of history substitution and wish to replace the
        current event (which invokes the substitution) with the command
        created through substitution. The return value is an empty string.

    hhiissttoorryy cclleeaarr
        Erase the history list. The current keep limit is retained. The
        history event numbers are reset.

    hhiissttoorryy eevveenntt ?event?
        Returns the value of the event given by event. Event defaults to --11.

    hhiissttoorryy iinnffoo?count?
        Returns a formatted string (intended for humans to read) giving the
        event number and contents for each of the events in the history list
        except the current event. If count is specified then only the most
        recent count events are returned.

    hhiissttoorryy kkeeeepp?count?
        This command may be used to change the size of the history list to
        count events. Initially, 20 events are retained in the history list.
        If count is not specified, the current keep limit is returned.

    hhiissttoorryy nneexxttiidd
        Returns the number of the next event to be recorded in the history
        list. It is useful for things like printing the event number in
        command-line prompts.

    hhiissttoorryy rreeddoo?event?
        Re-executes the command indicated by event and return its result.
        Event defaults to --11. This command results in history revision: see
        below for details.


  HHIISSTTOORRYY RREEVVIISSIIOONN

  Pre-8.0 Tcl had a complex history revision mechanism. The current mechanism
  is more limited, and the old history operations ssuubbssttiittuuttee and wwoorrddss have
  been removed. (As a consolation, the cclleeaarr operation was added.)

  The history option rreeddoo results in much simpler ``history revision''. When
  this option is invoked then the most recent event is modified to eliminate
  the history command and replace it with the result of the history command.
  If you want to redo an event without modifying history, then use the _ee_vv_ee_nn_tt
  operation to retrieve some event, and the aadddd operation to add it to
  history and execute it.
