  This writes an example file in either text or binary format. If the file
  name ends in .gz, .bz, .bz2, or .Z it will automatically be compressed. The
  -binary flag results in the file being written in binary format. Text is
  the default.

  This command is useful for converting text example files to standard text
  format or to binary format or for producing combined files after multiple
  sets have been appended. Only the stored examples will be written to the
  file, so if the example set is reading from a pipe, the pipe is ignored.

  Binary example files will be much quicker to load with _l_o_a_d_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s because
  little parsing is required. They will also tend to take up less space.
  However, if the inputs and targets have little precision (like 0 and 1
  values), a compressed text example file may be smaller than a compressed
  binary file.

  It is suggested that example files be given the extension .ex and binary
  example files the extension .bex, but this is not done automatically.

  If the -append flag is used, the examples will be appended to the file.
  This only works when writing text files. When appending to a file, the
  example set header information will not be written, only the examples
  themselves. Appending is useful for combining example sets, or perhaps for
  constructing them one example at a time.
