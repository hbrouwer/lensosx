        clientInfo [<client>]

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

  This command can only be run in the server. It returns information about
  the clients. With no client number specified it will report the number of
  clients connected and how many are currently training, testing, halted, or
  idle. It will then print information about each client.

  If a client number is given, just information about that client will be
  returned. The client information consists of its number, the IP address of
  the client, the name of the Tcl channel used to communicate with the
  client, the file descriptor of the connection, the port used for the
  connection, and the state of the client.

        lens> clientInfo
        2 clients  1 training  1 testing  0 halted  0 idle
        1  128.2.181.181 sock6 6 1687 testing
        2  128.2.181.181 sock7 7 1691 training

  To find out about just one client:

        lens> clientInfo 2
        2  128.2.181.181 sock7 7 1691 training
