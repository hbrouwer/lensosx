        waitForClients [<num-clients> [<command>]]

  This command is used to synchronize clients and servers at the start or end
  of training. It has several different functions. With no arguments,
  waitForClients acts as a barrier: If called by a client, the client will
  wait until the server releases it. If called by the server, the server will
  wait until all of the clients are also waiting and then the server will
  release itself and all clients. This is useful for ensuring that the
  clients and server are ready before training begins and is also useful at
  the end of training. A client can only call this command with no arguments.

  If waitForClients is called by the server with a single argument, the
  command will cause the server to wait until the specified number of clients
  have connected. The clients themselves need not make a wait call.

  Finally, if waitForClients is called by the server with a number of clients
  and a command, the command will be executed once that many clients have
  connected. If enough clients have already connected, the command will be
  executed and then waitForClients will return. Otherwise, waitForClients
  will return immediately and the command will be executed when enough
  clients have connected.

  To run the script "trainIt.in" once five clients have connected:

        lens> waitForClients 5 "source trainIt.in"

  To wait for five clients and then continue processing the current script:

        waitForClients 5
        sendObj learningRate 0.01
        ...
