  This command lays out the entire network in the Unit Viewer. It plots each
  group from last to first as if the group were plotted using _p_l_o_t_A_l_l.
  Normally, a blank row is left between groups. However, Elman context groups
  are plotted immediately below the previously plotted group and shifted to
  the right. This arrangement assumes that Elman layers will immediately
  precede their source groups in the group order.

  If plot-columns is specified, it will set the number of columns used in the
  layout. Otherwise, the number of columns is automatically determined based
  on the maximum number of units in any group.

  If the numColumns field for a group is set to something greater than 0, it
  will override the plot-columns in determining how many columns are used in
  plotting the group. This can be used to customize the layout short of
  specifying it entirely by hand.

  Once autoPlot called, it will be reinvoked whenever the structure of the
  network changes. If any other plotting command is given, automatic plotting
  will stop. New networks are by default in "autoPlot mode".
