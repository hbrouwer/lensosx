  This opens the graphical shell console. It doesn't work if Lens was
  originally started in batch mode. This can also be invoked from the WWiinnddooww//
  VViieeww CCoonnssoollee menu button on the main display. This command is generally
  used to regain the console window after it has been closed.

  If you close both the main window and the console window, you will no
  longer have control of your Lens process. Fortunately, you can regain
  control by sending it the USR2 signal using kill because the default
  sigUSR2Proc opens the main window. If you changed that, you are basically
  S.O.L.
