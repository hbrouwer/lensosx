  This opens the link viewer if it is closed or deiconifies it and brings it
  to the front if it is open.

  The -out flag is used to specify the group or groups whose outputs will be
  displayed. These are the "Sending Groups".

  The -in flag is used to specify the group or groups whose inputs will be
  displayed. These are the "Receiving Groups".

  If linkCellSize is given, it sets the network's linkCellSize field, which
  determines the size of the rectangles in the display. The initial default
  is 8.

  If linkCellSpacing is given, it sets the network's linkCellSpacing field,
  which determines the gap between rectangles in the display. The initial
  default is 0.

  If updateRate is given, it sets the frequency with which the Link Viewer is
  updated. A value of 0 means never, 3 is after each example, 4 is after
  weight updates, 5 is after progress reports, and 6 is after training or
  testing. The default is 5, after progress reports.
