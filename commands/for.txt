  FFoorr is a looping command, similar in structure to the C ffoorr statement. The
  start, next, and body arguments must be Tcl command strings, and test is an
  expression string. The ffoorr command first invokes the Tcl interpreter to
  execute start. Then it repeatedly evaluates test as an expression; if the
  result is non-zero it invokes the Tcl interpreter on body, then invokes the
  Tcl interpreter on next, then repeats the loop. The command terminates when
  test evaluates to 0. If a _cc_oo_nn_tt_ii_nn_uu_ee command is invoked within body then any
  remaining commands in the current execution of body are skipped; processing
  continues by invoking the Tcl interpreter on next, then evaluating test,
  and so on. If a _bb_rr_ee_aa_kk command is invoked within body or next, then the ffoorr
  command will return immediately. The operation of _bb_rr_ee_aa_kk and _cc_oo_nn_tt_ii_nn_uu_ee are
  similar to the corresponding statements in C. FFoorr returns an empty string.

  Note: test should almost always be enclosed in braces. If not, variable
  substitutions will be made before the ffoorr command starts executing, which
  means that variable changes made by the loop body will not be considered in
  the expression. This is likely to result in an infinite loop. If test is
  enclosed in braces, variable substitutions are delayed until the expression
  is evaluated (before each loop iteration), so changes in the variables will
  be visible. For an example, try the following script with and without the
  braces around $$xx<<1100:

    for {set x 0} {$x<10} {incr x} {
    	puts "x is $x"
    }
