  This opens the unit viewer if it is closed or deiconifies it and brings it
  to the front if it is open.

  If unitCellSize is given, it sets the network's unitCellSize field, which
  determines the size of the unit rectangles in the display. The initial
  default is 14.

  If unitCellSpacing is given, it sets the network's unitCellSpacing field,
  which determines the gap between rectangles in the display. The initial
  default is 2.

  If updateRate is given, it sets the frequency with which the Unit Viewer is
  updated. A value of 0 means never, 3 is after each example, 4 is after
  weight updates, 5 is after progress reports, and 6 is after training or
  testing. The default is 5, after progress reports.
