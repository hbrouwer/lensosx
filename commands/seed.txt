  This command seeds the random number generators used for randomizing
  weights, injecting noise, lesioning, created sparse connectivity, selecting
  examples, and other processes. It returns the seed value used.

  If a seed-value is specified, it is used as the seed. Otherwise, the seed
  is generated based on the current time and the process ID. It is extremely
  unlikely that this will result in identical seeds on multiple runs.

  The simulator is automatically time-seeded when it starts. It is a good
  idea to seed the generator (and store the seed value) immediately before
  doing anything, such as sparsely connecting groups or lesioning the
  network, that you may want to exactly repeat later.
