  This command will return the value of a Lens object. If the object is a
  simple field, such as an integer, real, or string, it will return the value
  as expected.

  If the field is a container object, all of the fields will be displayed. In
  addition, sub-objects will be traversed and their contents printed as well.
  max-depth sets the depth of traversal of sub-objects. The default value is
  1, which will display the names of sub-objects but not traverse them. A
  value of 0 will display just the name of the main object. A value of 2 will
  display the names of sub-sub-objects and sub-objects in arrays. A value of
  3 will display the contents of sub-sub-objects and the names of sub-objects
  in 2D arrays, and so on.

  The default object is the null string "{}" which refers to the current
  network.

  To see the number of units in the third group:

        lens> getObject group(2).numUnits
        50

  To see the fields of the current network:

        lens> getObject
        ...

  To see the contents of the current network down to level of the names of
  units and the contents of examples:

        lens> getObject -d 4
        ...
  To see the contents of the "hidden" group down to the level of the contents
  of units and pipe the result through more:

        lens> more << [getObject hidden -d 3]
        ...
