  This is a slightly modified version of the auto_mkindex command. It reads
  through all files that match at least one filter in the specified directory
  and creates a .tclIndex file which lists the procedures defined in each
  source file. The default directory is the current one and the default
  filters are "*.tcl" and "*.in".

  Subsequently, if an undefined procedure is invoked, Lens will look for it
  in all index files in the auto_path. If found, the correct file will be
  _s_o_u_r_c_e_d and the command executed. This is called autoloading. The auto_path
  is a normal Tcl list and can be customized in the _._l_e_n_s_r_c file.

  You don't need to call this function every time you start Lens. Only do it
  when you add a new procedure to one of your ".tcl" files.

  To make an index of all "*.tcl" and "*.in" files in the current directory:

        lens> index

  To make an index of all "*.in" and "net*" files in the directory "Scripts":

        lens> index Scripts *.in net*
