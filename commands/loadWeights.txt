  This reads weights (and possibly other values) for every link in the
  network from a special file written with _s_a_v_e_W_e_i_g_h_t_s. The file will not be
  loaded if it doesn't contain the same number of links as the current
  network. However, subtle differences in architecture will not be detected
  by this check. When using networks with randomized structures, it is
  important to have recorded the random seed used when building the network
  so the same architecture can be reconstructed later. Otherwise, previously
  stored weight files might be useless.

  This command will detect if the file contains link weight deltas or
  lastValues as well as weights and will load all of the values in the file.

  If -noFrozen is specified, values will only be loaded into non-frozen
  links. If -onlyFrozen is specified, values will only be loaded into frozen
  links. The number of links into which weights are being loaded must match
  the number of links stored in the file. This check will be made before
  anything is loaded.

  If the file name has the extension .gz, .bz, .bz2, or .Z, it will
  automatically be decompressed. This extension may be omitted when
  specifying the file name.

  Unless weights are only loaded to frozen links, the network's totalUpdates
  counter will be set to the value stored in the weight file, as this should
  indicate the number of updates that have been performed on the non-frozen
  weights.
