  This command performs several different operations on graphs. They are as
  follows:

  "graph create" creates a new graph and returns its name, which is an
  integer index into the root.graph() array. The new graph has no trace

  "graph list" returns a list of the numbers of all of the graphs.

  "graph delete <graph-list>" destroys all of the graphs whose numbers are
  listed. * refers to all graphs.

  "graph refresh <graph-list>" redraws one or more graphs. This may be
  necessary if you have directly changed a parameter for the graph using
  _s_e_t_O_b_j_e_c_t or the Object Viewer.

  "graph update <graph-list>" causes the active traces in the graph(s) to
  update themselves. This adds an additional point to the trace using the
  current value of the object or command that the trace is tracking. If the
  graph's updateEvery field is greater than 1, then an update may not
  actually occur every time this is called. If a graph has been configured to
  update NEVER, it won't be updated by this command.

  "graph store <graph-list>" causes the graphs in the list to store
  themselves. This creates an inactive and transient copy of the active
  traces, and then clears the active traces.

  "graph clear <graph-list>" causes the graphs in the list to clear
  themselves. This deletes the transient traces and clears the active traces.

  "graph hide <graph-list>" hides the graphs in the list. A graph that is
  hidden continue to update itself, but there is no graphical window so the
  graph updates are much faster.

  "graph show <graph-list>" shows all of the hidden graphs, creating windows
  for them. In BATCH mode, this does nothing.

  You can read more about graphs in the _G_r_a_p_h_s_ _s_e_c_t_i_o_n of the main manual.

  To create a graph, add a trace to it, change its columns to 500 and redraw
  it, do:

        lens> set g [graph create]
        lens> trace create $g error
        lens> setObject graph($g).cols 500
        lens> graph refresh $g
