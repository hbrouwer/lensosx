  With no argument, this returns a list of currently defined link types.
  Otherwise, this creates a new link type of the given name. Link types serve
  as handles to particular sets of links. Using types, one can selectively
  randomize, freeze, or delete certain links without affecting others. Types
  also allow the creation of multiple links between two units. Only one link
  of a particular type may exist from one unit to another. However, there
  could be multiple links provided they have distinct types.

  A link can only have one type. It is not possible to logically "or" types
  together when specifying a set of links. A link is given a type when it is
  created. Most commands that operate on links will accept a type name that
  will limit its effect to only links of that type. If no type is specified
  for such a function it will operate on every link, regardless of type.

  The only predefined link type is "bias". Bias links that are automatically
  created when a group is added are of this type. If no type is specified
  when a connection is formed using _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_G_r_o_u_p_s, _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_G_r_o_u_p_T_o_U_n_i_t_s, or
  _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_U_n_i_t_s, the default behavior is to give the links a type with the
  same name as the sending group. This type will be created if necessary. If
  a different type name is specified when a connection is formed, it too will
  be created if necessary. Therefore, there is no real reason for this
  command to exist except for printing out the list of link types.

  There can be up to 256 types defined concurrently. It would not be
  reasonable to give every link in the network its own type. If the type is
  already registered, addLinkType does not report an error.
