        sendEval <command> [<client>]

  DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN

  This is used to cause either the server or the clients to execute a
  command. This is a general form of communication between clients and the
  server.

  If invoked on a client, the specified command will be executed on the
  server. If invoked on the server, the command will be executed on each
  client, unless a client number is specified in which case it will be
  executed only on that client. Client numbers can be found by using the
  _c_l_i_e_n_t_I_n_f_o command.

  sendEval does not wait for the remote command to finish executing and does
  not return anything. If you would like the server to request information
  from a client, the server should use sendEval to tell the client to use
  sendEval again to send the information back to the server.

  If invoked in the server, this will cause all clients to run the script
  "buildNetwork.in":

        lens> sendEval {source buildNetwork.in}

  If invoked in the server, this will cause every client to print their own
  process id:

        lens> sendEval {puts [pid]}

  If invoked in the server, this will cause every client to print the
  server's process id:

        lens> sendEval "puts [pid]"

  If invoked in a client, this will cause all clients, including the sender,
  to exit:

        lens> sendEval {sendEval exit}
