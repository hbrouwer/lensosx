  This sets up the first group as the source for the second, context, group.
  The two groups must have the same number of units and the second must have
  an ELMAN_CLAMP output function that has not already been assigned a source
  group. Once this command is invoked, when the context group is updated, the
  output of each unit in the source group will be added to the output of the
  corresponding unit in the context group.

  The -reset option will set the resetOnExample parameter of the source
  group. This defaults to 1 or TRUE, which means that the outputs of the
  source group will be reset to the group's initOutput at the start of each
  example.

  The -initOutput option sets the source group's initOutput value. The
  default depends on the output type of the group, but is typically 0.5 for
  [0,1]-bounded groups.

  The resetOnExample and initOutput values could also be set directly with
  the _s_e_t_O_b_j_e_c_t command.

  To make group "context1" the context layer for group "hidden1" and have the
  unit outputs of the context layer reset to 0.1 at the start of each
  example:

        lens> elmanConnect hidden1 context1 -r 1 -i 0.1
