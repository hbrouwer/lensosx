  The if command evaluates expr1 as an expression (in the same way that _ee_xx_pp_rr
  evaluates its argument). The value of the expression must be a boolean (a
  numeric value, where 0 is false and anything is true, or a string value
  such as ttrruuee or yyeess for true and ffaallssee or nnoo for false); if it is true then
  body1 is executed by passing it to the Tcl interpreter. Otherwise expr2 is
  evaluated as an expression and if it is true then bbooddyy22 is executed, and so
  on. If none of the expressions evaluates to true then bodyN is executed.
  The tthheenn and eellssee arguments are optional ``noise words'' to make the
  command easier to read. There may be any number of eellsseeiiff clauses,
  including zero. BodyN may also be omitted as long as eellssee is omitted too.
  The return value from the command is the result of the body script that was
  executed, or an empty string if none of the expressions was non-zero and
  there was no bodyN.
