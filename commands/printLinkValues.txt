  This command is used to print information about links to a file. The first
  list of groups is the "senders" and the second list is the "receivers". The
  printProc Tcl procedure will be called once for each link from a sender to
  a receiver. If a link type is given, only links of that type will be
  printed.

  The printProc procedure should take six arguments. These are: the sending
  group path, the sending unit path, the receiving group path, the receiving
  unit path, the number of the link's block, and the number of the link in
  the receiving unit's incoming array.

  The string returned by each call to the procedure will be written to the
  file. The user, thus, determines the format of the output. The _f_o_r_m_a_t Tcl
  command may come in very handy here.

  The file can be specified using any of the standard Lens _f_i_l_e_ _t_y_p_e_s,
  including ordinary files, compressed files, pipelines, Tcl file handles,
  and a "-" for standard output. If you would like to periodically write
  values to a file, after each example for instance, you could _o_p_e_n a Tcl
  file, call printLinkValues after each example (maybe using the network's
  postExampleProc) and then _c_l_o_s_e the Tcl file, or simply use the -append
  flag, which causes the output to be appended to the file.

  Links to lesioned units are ignored when the values are printed.

  In this example, the sending unit name, receiving unit name, and link
  weight are printed for every link of type "special" leaving the groups
  "input" and "hidden". The output is sent to standard output.

        lens> proc printStuff {g1 u1 g2 u2 b l} {
                format "%s->%s %.3f\n" [getObj $u1.name] [getObj $u2.name] \
                  [getObj $u2.incoming($l).weight]
              }
        lens> printLinkValues - printStuff {input hidden} * -t special
