# This is a more complicated digit recognition task that data from actual
# handwritten digits.
# The training and test set come from different sets of people.  Sure you can
# get 100% accuracy on the training set, but can you break 98% on the test set?
# Try improving generalization with some weight decay (maybe around 0.001) or
# by changing the number of hidden units.
