# This is a simple sequence prediction task.  There are four symbols plus a
# terminating symbol.  The first symbol is random, the second is chosen from
# the other three, the third from the other two and then the three symbols are
# repeated.  You will probably find that the tasks are unlearnable without 
# using backpropTicks of at least 3.
